    <h2>Key Terms and Definitions</h2>

    <p>• <b>Credit Management:</b> The process of assessing creditworthiness, setting credit limits, monitoring accounts receivable, and managing collections to minimize risk and ensure healthy cash flow. </br></br>

        • <b>Interest Rates:</b> The percentage charged on a loan or earned on an investment, which affects how quickly debt can grow. </br></br>
        
        • <b>Inflation:</b> The general increase in prices over time that can erode purchasing power and affect loan repayment costs. </br></br>
        
        • <b>Credit Rating System:</b> Agencies like Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion use financial data to generate credit reports and scores. </br></br>
        
        • <b>Credit Score:</b> A numerical representation (often 300–850) of a person’s creditworthiness based on their credit history, outstanding debt, payment patterns, etc. </br></br>
        
        • <b>Factors Influencing Credit Score:</b> Payment history, credit utilization ratio, length of credit history, new credit inquiries, and credit mix. </br></br>
        
        • <b>Late Payments:</b> Payments made after the due date; these can severely lower your credit score. </br></br>
        
        • <b>Good vs. Bad Debt:</b> Good debt (e.g., student loans, mortgages) is often an investment in the future, whereas bad debt (e.g., high-interest credit cards with only minimum payments) can trap you in a cycle of debt. </br></br>
        
        • <b>Choosing a Credit Card:</b> Compare factors such as annual fees, rewards, interest rates, and credit limits; for many, a “first” credit card should offer manageable limits and low fees. </br></br>
        
        </p>

    <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>    

    <p>
        • Believing that one single number (the credit score) tells the whole story—when in reality, lenders examine detailed credit reports. </br></br>

        • Not understanding that late payments, even by a few days, can have a disproportionate impact on credit scores. </br>

        • Misconceptions around “good debt” vs. “bad debt”: Some may assume all debt is harmful, whereas responsible borrowing for education or a home can build credit if managed well. </br></br>

        • Overlooking the importance of reading the fine print when choosing a credit card (e.g., hidden fees, interest rate changes, and credit limit conditions). </br></br>

        • Failing to monitor one’s credit report regularly to catch errors.
